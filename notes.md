# Hungry Sharks the Game Notes
  
## Course of Action

### Pressing issues

- **Player motion using mouse.** we are currently drawing all objects and filling the scree white
- **Eating**
- **Growth**
- **Respawns**

We now have a baby-game

### The goal

- **fix the frame rate stuff**
- **AI movement/response**
  - **Make it impossible to go out of bounds**
  - **The player will have to corner the small, fast fish**
- **bigger you are, the more you require to grow**
  - **improve this**
- **Win/lose screen**
  - **(win/ lose detection)**
- **spawn predators further away**
- **boost**
  - this should take up health when you have it activated
  - cannot boost if health = 0
- Replace "avoid walls" with bounce in character move method

we now have a kids game
