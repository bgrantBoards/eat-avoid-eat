# EAE (Eat Avoid Eat)git

An ocean-themed eat-to-evolve game in Python.

## Description

EAE is an ocean-themed game all about eating, growing, and making it to the top of the food chain. The player starts out as a black goldfish whose goal is to eat the minnows that populate the ocean. Be careful, as more evolved fish will start spawning and tying to eat YOU! Upon eating enough of the surrounding minnows, your character model changes to the next fish in the evolution chain. As the player advances through species, they become able to eat species that are smaller in size.

The chain of evolution is as follows:

Minnow < goldfish < clown fish < cod < small shark < tuna < swordfish < hammerhead shark < great white shark < whale shark

Evolve to become the whale shark to win the game!
